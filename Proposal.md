# CSE591 - Dressing Recommendation by different Bayes Classifier
* In this project, I will do the dressing recommendation by different Bayes Classifier using Python 
* Will also analysis and compare different Bayes classifier

## (1) Problem Description
* We learned Bayes classifier in our class, and we have implemented the full Bayes and Naïve Bayes in our code by Python.  Meanwhile, there are different Bayes implements in Python unit and different Bayes models in Naïve Bayes, such as ‘Multinomial Naive Bayes’, ‘Bernoulli Naive Bayes’ etc. My project is to better understand different implementations of Bayes, and give the comparison of them.
* To do the comparison, I use a dressing dataset to do training and testing, the dataset is downloaded from [UCI website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dresses_Attribute_Sales "UCI dataset website")

## (2) Bayes classifier to be implemented and compared
### these models can be learned from the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html "scikit-learn")
*	Full Bayes
*	Gaussian Naive Bayes
*	Multinomial Naive Bayes
*	Bernoulli Naive Bayes


## (3) Implementation and language
* use python to implement the different Bayes classifier
* Find the library version for different Bayes classifier, run the result and compare with my own code

## (4) Result
* will give the result of my own code and library version code
* will compare the code from 4 aspects, and give the plot and report
	* Result veracity
	* Code clarity
	* Running time and efficiency
	* K-Folder test
