# CSE591 - Dressing Recommendation by different Bayes Classifier

##(1) Better programming and evaluation of the algorithms studied
In our class, we studied the Bayes classifier and implemented the Full and Navie Bayes in our code.
But in fact, there are more Bayes models in practicse, like:
*	Full Bayes
*	Gaussian Naive Bayes
*	Multinomial Naive Bayes
*	Bernoulli Naive Bayes

What we have implemented in class is Full Bayes and Gaussian Naive Bayes.In this project, I wll implement Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
Meanwhile, there are already Python library package for implementing these Bayes models, I will run and compare them with my own code and
analyse the difference and efficience, if possible, I will optimize any of them

##(2) Using a systematic method to program and evaluate other algorithms

##(3) Applying the algorithms to real data and questions of interest
